# Engineering

## AI is software engineering on hard mode

This means you need more good practice, not less. AI systems, like any other
software, need:

- Automated testing
- Good documentation
- [The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/)

## Handover accrues massive technical debt

Many enterprises have a one-way handover model. This is incredibly wasteful.

Like software, models are never finished. They need to be tweaked and retrained.

## Models are not weight files

Models are often treated as a special class of object often identified with
sklearn pickle, or tensorflow checkpoint. Whilst pickles and checkpoints have a
role to play, they are just binary artefacts that are required for the correct
operation of a program. Not hugely dissimilar from an image or stylesheet.
