# Research

- Notebooks suck

## Benchmarks are not a good proxy for expected utility

## Don't be squeamish about rules

## Look at the data

- c.f. mathematicians...
- and more obvious empiricists

## Get something working

## Solve the hard problem

## Be suspicious of good results

## Trust your gut

## You are not documenting (well) enough

- Keep a lab notebook
