# Useful AI

This is an opinionated guide to building Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems
that do useful work in the world.

```{note}
For brevity, we'll use "AI" to refer to our subject matter, but as will become
abundantly clear, this guide concerns systems that have a large Machine
Learning (ML) component.
```

## Who is this for?

You hopefully.

But more generally, anyone interested in building or helping to build AI systems
that do useful work. That includes, but is not limited to: business sponsors,
subject matter experts, product designers, UI/UX people, software engineers,
and, of course, AI practitioners.

## Why is this needed?

By definition, building AI systems is tricky.

We resort to AI when we don't understand a problem well enough to write a
regular program to solve it.Indeed, when we do figure out how to solve such a
problem, the solution is often discounted as no longer being
["Real AI"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect).

```{epigraph}
Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, "Oh,
that's just a computation."

-- Rodney Brooks
```

## The Real AI Fallacy

This flawed concept of "Real AI" is at the root of many obstacles to building
useful AI systems.

First, it misleads stakeholders and sets AI projects up for failure -- sometimes
in spite of their success!

Another manifestation of this error, is the tendency to focus on how AI systems
differ from regular software. But, please, if you take nothing else away from
this guide, embrace the reality that AI systems are just software.

Finally, an perhaps most perniciously of all, it misleads practitioners
themselves. This results in tension, unhappiness and under-performance.
